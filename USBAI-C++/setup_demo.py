    TEAM MEETING RECORDING - MARCH 10, 2024

    [00:00:00 - 00:02:30] Introduction and agenda review

    SARAH: Good morning everyone. Today we'll discuss the Q2 project timeline,
    resource allocation, and upcoming deadlines. Let's start with project status updates.

    [00:02:30 - 00:05:20] Development team update

    MIKE: The development team has completed the core authentication module.
    We're currently working on the dashboard redesign and expect to finish by next Friday.
    However, we're running behind on the mobile responsiveness features.

    [00:05:20 - 00:08:15] Deadline discussion

    SARAH: Mike, you mentioned being behind on mobile features. How much time do you need?

    MIKE: I'd say we need at least two additional weeks. The current deadline of April 30th
    is too aggressive given our current resource constraints.

    ALEX: I agree with Mike. The design complexity for mobile is higher than initially estimated.

    SARAH: Let me check with management about extending the deadline. We might need to bring in
    external contractors to help meet the original timeline.

    [00:08:15 - 00:10:45] Quality assurance update

    EMILY: QA has completed testing on the authentication module. We found and fixed two critical bugs.
    Performance testing shows improved response times. We're ready to start API integration testing.

    [00:10:45 - 00:12:00] Action items and next steps

    SARAH: Alright, let's summarize action items:
    1. Mike to provide detailed mobile development estimate by Wednesday
    2. I'll discuss deadline extension with stakeholders
    3. Emily to begin API integration testing
    4. Alex to finalize mobile design requirements

    Next meeting scheduled for March 17th.
